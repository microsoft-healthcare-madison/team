# Health Interop Team Overview

Guiding vision: learning health system & patient-centered interop

* Identify gaps and areas of under-investment in health interop
    * e.g., Slow data flow into patient apps --> Suscriptions
    * e.g., Clinical challenges of incorporating assessment data --> Profile develpoment
    * e.g., Insufficient patient controls in TEFCA --> Policy advocacy
* Advocate, coordinate, and lead developement of interop standards
    * e.g., within HL7 and accelerators like Argonaut Project
    * e.g., [FHIR Subscriptions](https://build.fhir.org/subscriptions)
    * e.g., [Structured Data Capture](http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/sdc/)
    * e.g., [SMART Health Cards](https://spec.smarthealth.cards) and [SMART Health Links](https://hackmd.io/@vci/smart-health-links)
* Bring engineering practices to HL7's spec development
    * Open source reference implementations and sandboxes
        * e.g., [subscriptions.argo.run](subscriptions.argo.run)
        * e.g., fhirpath-lab.azurewebsites.net
    * Testing and continuous integration
        * e.g., github.com/fhir/auto-ig-builder ([dashboard](https://fhir.github.io/auto-ig-builder/builds.html))
* Make interop specs easier to learn and adopt
    * Libraries and tools
        * e.g., github.com/microsoft/fhir-codegen
        * e.g., github.com/fhir-typescript/fhir-typescript
        * e.g., github.com/brianpos/fhir-net-web-api
    * Tutorials, open discussion, education
        * e.g., brianpos.com
        * e.g., youtube.com/c/GinoCanessa/videos
        * e.g., youtube.com/c/JoshMandelMD/videos
