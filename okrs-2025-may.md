## Enhanced tooling to support IG creators and consumers
* P3 (BP) FML Tooling Updates for the cross version maps leveraging Gino's database and new extensions pack
    * Today, some FML transforms use cross-version extensions (but ad-hoc, may not match formal definitions)

* P4 (BP) UploadFIG to validate cross version extensions using the "new" extension pack
* Prototyping activities:
    * P3 (BP) FML Validator onto nuget - consider permanent home

* P0 (GC) Finish "automatic" processing pass of software to run comparisons and save to database
* P0 (GC) Generate markdown documentation of all mappings from the database
* P1 (GC) Review/coordinate review of all mappings
* P0 (GC) Generate FHIR Extensions based on the mappings in the database
* P0 (GC) Publish the cross-version extensions packages

## FHIR community has a concrete plan for R6+ resource development
* P0 (GC) Coordinate with Grahame to update proposal prior to Madrid WGM
    * [Overview thread from Grahame](https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/channel/179280-fhir.2Finfrastructure-wg/topic/Proposed.20R6.20change.3A.20Opening.20up.20for.20other.20resources)
    * P1 (GC) Proposal for naming / registering name(spaces)

    * P0 Basic chat-style functionality
    * P1 Spec parsing for RAG
    * P5 LOINC / SNOMED / RxNorm for RAG (get FHIR definitions from [Josh](https://github.com/jmandel/fhir-concept-publication-demo))
    * P1 Define FHIR Operations for FHIR-server feedback (tool calls - MCP?)
        * e.g., "validate search", or "parse search"
    * P3 Simple way of comparing models / results
    * P0 Present at DevDays
    * P99 (BP) FHIRPath tools/resources available as MCP servers (tool calls)
