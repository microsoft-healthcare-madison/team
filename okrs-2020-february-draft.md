## OKRs for Feb 2020

We follow a planning schedule that mirrors the HL7 workging group meeting
schedule -- in four-month intervals ending in September, January, and May.
(In 2020, the "January" meeting is later than usual, so this doc is scoped
to February 2020.)

P0: Complete conformance language in the Argonaut Encounter IG

P0: Ensure complete support in Reference Implementation

P1: Format the IG for publication using HL7's publisher template

P1: Publish the guide through Argonaut

P2: Prepare a community tutorial showing how to build a well-behaved
    Encoutner Subscriptions client, including error handling (e.g.,
    missed message detection, out-of-order delivery).

## Objective: Prepare FHIR R5 Topic-based Subscriptions for ballot

P0: Solicit design review from at least two cloud engineering teams
    (e.g., re: "eventCount" or other scaling concerns)

P0: Complete definition for "built-in" channel types (including Web Sockets, E-mail)

P0: Ensure full support for built-in channel types in Reference Implementation

P1: Document how developers can use our tooling and deploy their own copies of
    the core components of our reference implementation (server, client, and test
    harness) including locally via docker

P3: Build out tooling for arbitrary (computable) Topic definition / testing.

## Objective: Wrap up Argonaut PAMA IG

P0: Format the IG for publication (e.g. using mkdocs or HL7's publisher template)

P1: Prepare a community tutorial with code samples and end-to-end walk-through
    demonstrating the three key PAMA interactions.

P1: Put SMART Web Messaging onto HL7's standards track with a Project Scope Statement,
    and a "standard for trial use" ballot



## Objective: Establish Argonaut 2020 project for "SMART Scheduling Links"

P0: Submit 2020 project proposal for "SMART Scheduling Links"

P1: Develop a list of supporting organizations including at least three Argonaut participants



## Objective: Develop an open-source Patient On-ramp to TEFCA access

P0: Determine the right organizational entry-point (e.g., within Carequality, Commonwell)

P0: Discuss opportunities to co-develop with at least two outside organizations

P0: Publish a design document that covers identity proofing plug-ins, app registration
    allowing for public client registration, developer-facing questionnaires, published
    app lists, and a SMART proxy to TEFCA.
